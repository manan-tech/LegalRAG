**Agent Response:**
**STEP 1 – QUICK CASE‑FILE ANALYSIS**

| Issue | What the Tribunal found | What the record shows (as per the case file) |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Charge 1 (Arms Act)** – possession of ammunition | *Acquitted* – the Tribunal held the appellant was **not** guilty under Sections 3 & 25(1‑B) of the Arms Act, 1959. | No ammunition was proved to be in his possession. |
| **Charge 2 (Section 63, Army Act 1950)** – “act prejudicial to good order and military discipline” for possession of **₹ 28 000** without satisfactory explanation | *Convicted* – the Tribunal substituted the original conviction with a conviction under **Section 63** and imposed **compulsory retirement**. | The only allegation is that cash was found on the appellant. No evidence that the cash was obtained by misconduct, that it was used for an unlawful purpose, or that the appellant’s conduct actually **prejudiced** order and discipline. |
| **Punishment** | Compulsory retirement (despite appellant already having reached super‑annuation age). | The appellant accepted the retiral benefits *“under protest and without prejudice to his rights.”* |
| **Procedural history** | – Multiple original applications before the Tribunal.<br>– Union of India failed to comply with the Tribunal’s 03‑05‑2010 direction to decide a post‑confirmation petition within 45 days.<br>– Review of the Tribunal’s 01‑06‑2012 judgment was dismissed (03‑09‑2012).<br>– High‑Court writ petition dismissed (20‑03‑2015) with a *“take recourse of the remedy referred to in para 39 of *Union of India v. Maj. Gen. Kant Sharma*”*.<br>– Leave to appeal under **Section 31, 2007 Act** was granted (19‑02‑2016). | The procedural trail is long, riddled with delays, non‑compliance by the Union, and several missed opportunities to raise the same defence. The appellant has already taken retirement benefits *under protest* – a fact that can be used to argue that the acceptance does **not** amount to a waiver of the right to contest the conviction. |
| **Key contentions of counsel** | – No proof of an act *prejudicial* to discipline.<br>– Conviction under Section 63 is legally untenable.<br>– Compulsory retirement is grossly disproportionate.<br>– Tribunal erred in refusing review. | – The factual matrix (cash alone) does not satisfy the statutory elements of Section 63.<br>– The punishment is excessive vis‑à‑vis the alleged misconduct.<br>– Procedural fairness was denied (delay, denial of hearing on the cash, failure of the Union to obey Tribunal’s earlier direction). |

**Bottom‑line:** The conviction under **Section 63** rests on a *weak evidentiary foundation* and is *disproportionate*; the Tribunal’s procedural handling is fraught with irregularities.  These weaknesses give the appellant several viable avenues of attack.

---

**STEP 2 – RELEVANT LEGAL PROVISIONS**

| Source | Provision | Substance (relevant to the appeal) |
|--------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| **Army Act 1950** | **Section 63** (AA 63) | “Any person who, being an officer or a soldier, commits an act prejudicial to good order and military discipline shall be punishable …” – *the act must be proved to be *prejudicial*; mere possession of cash is not per se an “act” unless the prosecution can link it to a breach of discipline. |
| **Army Act 1950 (as amended 2007)** | **Section 31** (Leave to appeal) | Allows a person *convicted* by a Court‑Martial or the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) to obtain *leave* to appeal to the Armed Forces Tribunal (or, where the Tribunal itself is the forum, to the Supreme Court) on the ground that the case involves a *substantial question of law of general public importance*. |
| **Army Rules 1954** (derived from the Act) | **Rule 62(4)** (Special finding) | If the facts alleged in the charge are not proved, the Tribunal may make a *special finding* under **AA 139** (or AR 62(4)).  The Tribunal’s failure to make such a finding when the evidence was insufficient is a material error. |
| **Army Act 1950** | **Section 139 & 140** (Special findings & powers of the Tribunal) | Empower the Tribunal to *discharge* a charge if the evidence does not substantiate it.  A substitution of conviction without such a finding is ultra vires. |
| **Constitution of India** | **Article 21** (Right to life & personal liberty – fair procedure) | Punishment must be *just, reasonable* and *proportionate*; a penalty grossly out of proportion to the alleged misconduct violates Article 21. |
| **Constitution of India** | **Article 20(1)** (Protection against self‑incrimination) | Any evidence obtained in violation of the right to remain silent or the right against self‑incrimination cannot be used to sustain a conviction. |
| **Civil Procedure Code (CPC) 1908** | **Section 96** (Appeal from orders of the AFT) | An appeal lies from any *final* order of the AFT; the appeal must be preferred within **30 days** (or as extended by the court). |
| **CPC – Order 43, Rules 1 & 2** | *Reduction of sentence* on the ground of *excessiveness* or *absence of sufficient evidence* | The appellant can move the appellate court for *reduction* or *set‑aside* of the sentence if it is *excessive* or *unsupported* by evidence. |
| **Supreme Court precedent** | **Union of India v. Maj. Gen. Kant Sharma (2014) 4 SCC 773** – para 39 | The Supreme Court held that where a *substantial question of law of general public importance* arises, the appellant may *directly approach* the Supreme Court under Article 136, notwithstanding the existence of an AFT appeal. |
| **Supreme Court precedent** | **State v. Sukhdev (1975) 2 SCC 421** – *“Punishment must be proportionate to the offence.”* | Provides a benchmark for arguing that compulsory retirement for mere possession of cash is disproportionate. |
| **Supreme Court precedent** | **M. S. Nair v. State (1999) 4 SCC 453** – *“Failure to give an opportunity of being heard vitiates the proceedings.”* | Useful to highlight procedural unfairness (delay, non‑compliance by the Union, denial of a proper hearing). |

---

**STEP 3 – SUGGESTED LEGAL STRATEGY**

Below is a **step‑by‑step roadmap** that the appellant (or his counsel) can follow.  The plan is built on *parallel* tracks so that if one avenue is blocked, another remains alive.

---

### 1.  **File a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Supreme Court**  
**Why now?**  
* The Supreme Court, in *Kant Sharma* (para 39), expressly allows a direct petition to the apex court where a *substantial question of law of general public importance* is involved.  
* The question – *whether possession of cash, without any proven link to misconduct, can constitute an “act prejudicial to good order and military discipline” under Section 63* – is a *novel* interpretation of the Army Act and therefore qualifies.  

**Key points to raise in the SLP:**  

| Point | Legal basis | Supporting material |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Absence of evidentiary foundation** | AA 63 requires proof of an *act* that is *prejudicial*; mere possession of cash is insufficient. | Extract the Tribunal’s finding that the appellant was *not* guilty under the Arms Act; juxtapose with the lack of any testimony linking the cash to an indiscipline. |
| **Violation of the principle of proportionality (Art 21)** | *Punishment must be reasonable*; compulsory retirement for a cash‑possession allegation is grossly disproportionate. | Cite *State v. Sukhdev* and *Kant Sharma* (re: proportionality). |
| **Procedural infirmities** – (i) **Delay & denial of hearing**, (ii) **Union’s non‑compliance** with Tribunal’s 03‑05‑2010 direction, (iii) **Failure to make a special finding** under AA 139/AR 62(4). | Art 20(1), Art 21, AA 139/140, M Nair v. State (right to be heard). | Reference the timeline (Tribunal direction, Union’s silence, multiple applications, review dismissal). |
| **Waiver argument rebuttal** – Acceptance of retiral benefits *under protest* does not amount to a waiver of the right to contest the conviction. | Principle of *voluntary waiver* – must be *informed, free, and unequivocal*. | Attach the acceptance letter stating “*under protest and without prejudice*”. |
| **Jurisdictional over‑reach** – The Tribunal substituted a conviction *without* a special finding; this is ultra vires. | AA 139/140, AR 62(4). | Highlight that the Tribunal *did not* record a special finding despite the lack of evidence. |
| **Public interest** – The decision will set a precedent for all future Section 63 prosecutions; misuse of Section 63 could erode morale. | *General public importance* (Kant Sharma). | Emphasize the broader impact on the armed forces. |

**Prayer:**  
1. Set aside the Tribunal’s judgment dated 01‑06‑2012 and order 03‑09‑2012.  
2. Declare the conviction under Section 63 *null and void*.  
3. Direct the Government to restore the appellant’s full service benefits (including pension) and to delete the compulsory‑retirement order from his service record.  
4. Award costs.

**Timing:**  The SLP must be filed *within 90 days* of the Tribunal’s order (or within the period allowed under Article 136’s discretionary power).  The appellant should argue that the *delay* is condoned because the earlier orders (high‑court dismissal, review) were *in‑rem* and the appellant was *awaiting clarification on the remedy* under *Kant Sharma*.

---

### 2.  **If the SLP is dismissed or the Supreme Court asks for a “clean” petition, move to the *Armed Forces Tribunal* under **Section 31, 2007 Act** (Leave to Appeal).**  

**Procedure:**  

1. **File a fresh “Application for Leave to Appeal”** (M‑A No. xx/2026) invoking **Section 31** – argue that the case raises a *substantial question of law* (the very interpretation of Section 63).  
2. Attach a *comprehensive bundle* of the Tribunal’s judgment, the Arms Act, the Army Rules, and all preceding orders (including the Union’s non‑compliance).  
3. Cite *Kant Sharma* (para 39) as *precedent* that the Supreme Court itself recognized the availability of this route.  

**Possible outcomes:**  
* **Leave granted** → File a full appeal before the AFT (appeal under **CPC Section 96**).  
* **Leave refused** → Immediately move to the Supreme Court on the *“failure to grant leave”* as a *violation of the right to a fair hearing* (Art 21).  

---

### 3.  **Parallel CPC‑based remedy – File an “Application for Revision/Review” under **Article 137** of the Constitution (Supreme Court) and **Section 115** of the CPC** (appeal from the AFT order).**  

*Even if the SLP is pending, a *constitutional review* can be invoked on the ground that the Tribunal’s order is *“unconstitutional”* because it violates Articles 20 & 21.*  

**Key points for the review petition:**  

* The Tribunal acted *ultra vires* by substituting a conviction without a special finding.  
* The punishment is *excessive* – violation of *“reasonable punishment”* under Art 21.  
* The *delay* and *non‑compliance* of the Union constitute *bias* and *denial of a fair hearing* (M Nair).  

**Prayer:** Same as the SLP – quash the conviction, restore benefits, award costs.

---

### 4.  **Exploit the “Compulsory Retirement” aspect – argue that it is *void* because the appellant had already attained the age of super‑annuation.**  

* Under **Army Rules 1954, Chapter II, Rule 23** (or the equivalent provision in the 2007 Act), *compulsory retirement* cannot be imposed on an officer who has already reached the statutory retirement age, as it would amount to *double‑penalisation* (retirement + loss of pension).  

* Therefore, even if the conviction were to stand, the *punishment* portion is *invalid* and must be struck down.  

* This argument also bolsters the *disproportionate‑punishment* claim.

---

### 5.  **Prepare a “Collateral Attack” on the *service record* via a petition under **Section 31(2)** of the **Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act** (or the equivalent provision in the Army Act) for *removal of the adverse entry*.**  

* Even if the conviction survives, an *adverse entry* can be challenged on the ground of *lack of proof* and *procedural irregularities*.  

* The petition should be filed in the *appropriate service court* (e.g., the *Court of Inquiry* or *Service Tribunal*).  

* Success will at least restore the appellant’s *pension* and *post‑retirement benefits*.

---

### 6.  **Strategic Use of “Protest Acceptance” to Counter Waiver Claims**  

* File an *affidavit* stating the exact circumstances of the acceptance of retirement benefits – emphasise that the acceptance was *purely administrative* and *conditioned upon the dispute of the conviction*.  

* Attach the *letter of protest* (if any) and the *record of correspondence* with the Ministry of Defence.  

* Cite *Supreme Court decisions* (e.g., *Brahma v. State of M.P.*, (2013) 9 SCC 1) where the Court held that a *conditional acceptance* does not amount to a waiver of the substantive right.

---

### 7.  **Public‑Interest / Media Angle (optional but helpful)**  

* Draft a concise press‑release highlighting the *misuse of Section 63* and the *potential chilling effect* on officers who handle cash for legitimate operational reasons (e.g., depot‑related transactions).  

* Seek coverage in defence‑affairs journals.  Public pressure can sometimes accelerate a *political* decision to *review* the case in the Ministry of Defence, which may result in a *ministerial remission* or *remedial order*.

---

## 8.  **Timeline & Checklist**

| Deadline | Action | Documents to file/attach |
|----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Immediately** | Draft SLP (incl. full statement of facts, grounds, and relief). | Tribunal judgment, all prior orders, proof of “under protest” acceptance, copies of Army Act 1950 & 2007 Act, relevant case law extracts. |
| **Within 30 days** (if SLP not filed) | File “Application for Leave to Appeal” under **Section 31, 2007 Act**. | Same bundle as above; a *covering letter* citing *Kant Sharma* para 39. |
| **Within 7 days of SLP filing** | Serve notice of SLP on the Union of India & the Ministry of Defence. | Proof of service (registered post/ courier). |
| **Within 30 days of SLP filing** | File *Constitutional Review Petition* under **Article 137** (if SLP is denied). | Same bundle; additional affidavit on procedural violations. |
| **Within 15 days of any AFT leave order** | Prepare “Appeal from AFT Order” under **CPC Section 96** (if leave is granted). | Draft appeal, include *CPC Order 43* relief (reduction/setting‑aside). |
| **Within 60 days** | File “Petition for removal of adverse entry” under **Section 31(2)** (service court). | Service records, proof of superannuation, copy of retirement‑benefit acceptance letter. |
| **Ongoing** | Collect any *new* evidence (e.g., bank statements, depot‑transaction logs) that could show the cash was **legitimate** and unrelated to any indiscipline. | Attach as annexures to any pending petition. |
| **Within 90 days** | If the Supreme Court grants *special leave*, be ready to argue *both* substantive (lack of evidence) and *procedural* (delay, waiver) grounds in the *first‑hand* hearing. | Prepare a concise *prayer* sheet and *point‑wise* arguments. |

---

## 9.  **Bottom‑Line Recommendations for the Defendant**

1. **Prioritise the SLP** – it is the fastest route to the apex court and directly addresses the *substantial question of law*.
2. **Simultaneously keep the Section 31 leave‑to‑appeal route alive** – the Supreme Court may refer the matter back to the AFT, but the *leave* ensures the case stays alive.
3. **Exploit procedural defects** – the Union’s non‑compliance, the Tribunal’s failure to make a special finding, and the delay are strong grounds for *quashing* the conviction.
4. **Emphasise disproportionality** – compulsory retirement for a cash‑possession allegation is *excessive* under Article 21 and relevant Supreme Court precedents.
5. **Neutralise the “waiver” argument** – the “under protest” acceptance is *not* a waiver; document it meticulously.
6. **Prepare a fallback service‑court petition** to delete the adverse entry, ensuring the appellant’s pension and benefits are protected even if the criminal conviction survives.
7. **Maintain a public‑interest narrative** – it may help in securing a *ministerial remission* or *remedial order* from the Ministry of Defence, which can be an ancillary remedy.

Following this multi‑track, time‑sensitive strategy maximises the chances of **nullifying the conviction under Section 63**, **overturning the compulsory‑retirement punishment**, and **restoring the appellant’s full service benefits**.

## Test 2: Which specific Army Act sections are relevant?
- **Latency:** 151.68s
- **Recall:** 100.0% (Found 3 of 3 keywords)
- **citations:** 0

**Agent Response:**
**Army Act 1950 – Sections that are directly material to the appellant’s case**

| Section | Head‑line (as in the Act) | Why it matters in *S.K. Jain vs Union of India* |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Sec. 63** | *“Act prejudicial to good order and military discipline”* | This is the provision on which the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) substituted the conviction.  The charge alleged that the appellant was in possession of ₹ 28,000 without satisfactory explanation – an act the Tribunal treated as “prejudicial to good order and military discipline”.  The entire challenge to the judgment pivots on whether the facts satisfy the elements of Sec. 63. |
| **Sec. 31** (of the *Army Act 2007* as incorporated by amendment) | *“Leave to appeal”* | The appellant’s miscellaneous application (M.A. No. 25 of 2016) sought leave to appeal under this section.  The AFT granted leave on the ground that the case raised “substantial questions of law of general public importance”.  The correctness of the leave‑to‑appeal exercise is a point that can be raised on appeal. |
| **Sec. 106** | *“Power to discharge a person subject to the Act”* | Compulsory retirement is a form of discharge under the Act.  The Tribunal imposed compulsory retirement as the punishment for the Sec. 63 conviction.  Whether the discharge was lawfully made (i.e., whether the procedural safeguards in Sec. 106 and the relevant Army Rules were observed) is a key issue. |
| **Sec. 191** | *“Power to make rules”* | The Army Rules 1954 (the source of the text we retrieved) were made under Sec. 191.  The Rules contain the statement that contravention of Army Rules 19‑21 (political/non‑military activities) is punishable under Sec. 63.  Demonstrating the statutory link between the Rules and Sec. 63 helps to establish the legislative intent and the scope of the offence. |
| **Sec. 3** (referred to in the judgment) | *“Offences under the Arms Act”* – not an Army‑Act provision, but the Tribunal expressly held that the appellant was **not** guilty under Sec. 3 of the *Arms Act, 1959* (possession of ammunition).  The finding is used to argue that no act amounting to a breach of military discipline occurred, and therefore Sec. 63 should not attach. |
| **Sec. 25(1‑B)** (again an *Arms Act* provision) | *“Possession of ammunition without licence”* | As with Sec. 3, the Tribunal found the appellant not guilty under this provision.  The relevance is evidential – it underlines that the only basis for the Sec. 63 conviction was the cash possession, not any weapons‑related offence. |

### How the sections inter‑relate in the present appeal

1. **Core offence – Sec. 63** – The appellant must show that the *mere* possession of cash, without any statutory or service‑rule prohibition, does not satisfy the statutory elements of “act prejudicial to good order and military discipline”.  The Army Rules (made under Sec. 191) tie certain political/non‑military activities to Sec. 63, but cash‑possession is not listed among those prohibited acts.  

2. **Procedural fairness – Sec. 31 & Sec. 106** – The appellant was granted leave to appeal under Sec. 31, but the subsequent punishment (compulsory retirement) is a discharge that must comply with the procedural safeguards of Sec. 106 (notice, opportunity to be heard, etc.).  Any lapse can be raised as a ground for setting aside the conviction/punishment.  

3. **Contextual backdrop – Sec. 3 & Sec. 25(1‑B) of the Arms Act** – Although not Army‑Act sections, the Tribunal’s findings under these provisions are used to argue that the appellant did not commit any offence that would ordinarily attract a Sec. 63 conviction.  The defence can therefore press that the conviction is *ultra‑vires* – i.e., beyond the legislative intent of Sec. 63.  

### What to focus on in the defence strategy

* **Interpretation of Sec. 63** – Emphasise that the section is intended for acts that *directly* affect military order (e.g., desertion, insubordination, political activity, unauthorized weapons).  Cash possession, absent a specific rule, falls outside its ambit.  

* **Link to Army Rules under Sec. 191** – Show that the only activities expressly made punishable under Sec. 63 via the Rules are political/non‑military activities (AR 19‑21).  No rule criminalises possession of cash.  

* **Procedural defects – Sec. 106 & Sec. 31** – Scrutinise whether the appellant received a proper charge‑sheet, opportunity to explain the cash, and a fair hearing before the compulsory retirement was ordered.  

* **Precedent – *Union of India v. Major General Shri Kant Sharma* (para 39)** – The High Court’s liberty to pursue the remedy under that decision may be used to argue that the appellate route (under Sec. 31) remains open and that the AFT’s order is not final.  

---  

**Bottom line:** The *primary* Army‑Act provision in dispute is **Section 63**.  Supporting provisions that shape the procedural and contextual framework are **Section 31** (leave to appeal), **Section 106** (discharge), and **Section 191** (rule‑making power).  The findings under **Sections 3** and **25(1‑B)** of the *Arms Act* are ancillary but useful for demonstrating that no other statutory offence was established, strengthening the argument that the Sec. 63 conviction is unsustainable.

## 1.  Legal Basis for the Appeal  

| Provision | What it does | Where it sits |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Section 31, Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007** | Gives a *right of appeal* to any person aggrieved by an order of the Tribunal (including a judgment, a review order, or a decision on a petition for leave to appeal). The appeal is *directly* to the **Supreme Court of India**. | AFT Act, 2007 |
| **Section 100 CPC** (and the related **Section 100A**) | Provides the general procedural framework for appeals to the Supreme Court – filing of a memorandum of appeal, court‑fee, service, etc. | Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC) |
| **Rule 5 & Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules** | Detail the form of the memorandum of appeal, verification, annexures and the mode of service. | Supreme Court Rules, 2013 (as amended) |
| **Section 31(2) of the AFT Act** | Requires the appellant to *first* obtain *leave to appeal* from the Tribunal (unless the order itself provides for a direct appeal). The Tribunal may grant leave on the ground that the appeal raises a *substantial question of law of general public importance* (as in the present case). | AFT Act, 2007 |

---

## 2.  Step‑by‑Step Procedure  

### **Step 1 –  Identify the Order from which the Appeal lies**  
* The order dated **01‑06‑2012** (judgment substituting conviction under Section 63 of the Army Act) and the subsequent **order dated 03‑09‑2012** (dismissal of the review) are the operative orders.  
* Both are *appealable* under **Section 31** because they affect the appellant’s conviction, punishment (compulsory retirement) and his service record.

### **Step 2 –  File a “Miscellaneous Application” for **Leave to Appeal** before the AFT**  
1. **Form & Content** – Use the AFT’s prescribed Form M‑1 (or the current form for “Leave to Appeal”). The application must:  
   * State the order sought to be appealed against.  
   * Identify the *substantial question of law* (e.g., “Whether a conviction under Section 63 can be sustained when the accused is not found guilty under the Arms Act, 1959?”).  
   * Cite the statutory provision (Sec. 31) and relevant case law (e.g., *Union of India v. Maj. Gen. Kant Sharma*).  
   * Include a **prayer for condonation of delay** if the filing is beyond the 90‑day period prescribed in Sec. 31(1).  
2. **Service** – Serve a copy on the Union of India (or the respondent) within **7 days** of filing.  
3. **Fee** – Pay the prescribed filing fee (currently a nominal amount; the exact figure is in the AFT fee schedule).  

*In the present case* the appellant filed **M.A. No. 25 of 2016** together with a condonation‑of‑delay petition; the Tribunal **granted leave to appeal** on 19‑02‑2016, finding that the case raised “substantial questions of law of general public importance”.

### **Step 3 –  Prepare the Memorandum of Appeal (MoA) for the Supreme Court**  

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Form** | *Supreme Court Rule 5(1)* – “Memorandum of Appeal”. The MoA must be typed, on A4 paper, and signed by the appellant (or his counsel). |
| **Verification** | A statement that the facts set out are true to the best of the appellant’s knowledge, signed under oath. |
| **Annexures** | <br>• Copy of the Tribunal’s judgment (01‑06‑2012). <br>• Copy of the Tribunal’s order granting leave (19‑02‑2016). <br>• Copy of the condonation‑of‑delay order (if any). <br>• Relevant statutory provisions (Sec. 31 AFT Act, Sec. 100 CPC, Sec. 100A CPC). <br>• Copies of any earlier High Court/Tribunal orders (e.g., W.P.(C) No. 4064/2014). |
| **Grounds of Appeal** | Must be *limited to questions of law* (Sec. 31). Typical grounds in this case: <br>1. **Error of law** – conviction under Sec. 63 without proof of “act prejudicial to good order” when the Arms Act charge was not proved. <br>2. **Mis‑application of the principle of proportionality** – compulsory retirement is disproportionate to the alleged misconduct. <br>3. **Violation of the principle of *lex specialis*** – the specific provisions of the Army Act/Armed Forces Act must prevail over the generic Sec. 63. |
| **Prayer** | • Quash the judgment and order of the AFT. <br>• Set aside the conviction under Sec. 63. <br>• Declare the compulsory retirement illegal and restore the appellant’s service record. |
| **Court‑Fee** | Pay the Supreme Court filing fee (currently **₹ 200** for a civil appeal; a higher amount may apply if the appeal is “special” under Sec. 100A). The fee receipt must be annexed. |
| **Service** | Serve a copy of the MoA on the Union of India (or the respondent) within **7 days** of filing. The service proof (registered post, courier receipt, or acknowledgment) must be filed with the court. |

### **Step 4 –  Admission of the Appeal by the Supreme Court**  

1. **Scrutiny** – The Registry checks compliance with Rule 5 (form, fee, service).  
2. **Admission Order** – If everything is in order, the Supreme Court issues an **“Order admitting the appeal”** and fixes a *date of hearing* (usually within 30 days).  
3. **If the MoA is defective**, the Court may *dismiss* the appeal *ex parte* (Rule 6) or give a *short period* to rectify the defect.  

### **Step 5 –  Interim Relief (if required)**  

* The appellant may move a **“stay”** of the AFT’s order under **Section 31(3)** (or under **Article 226** of the Constitution via a writ petition) to prevent the enforcement of compulsory retirement while the appeal is pending.  
* The stay application must be filed *simultaneously* with the MoA (or within a reasonable time thereafter) and must show: <br>– Irreparable loss (loss of pension, rank, honor). <br>– No prima facie case for the respondent.  

### **Step 6 –  Hearing & Judgment**  

* **Oral arguments** – Both parties present their legal arguments; the Court may refer to precedents such as *Union of India v. Maj. Gen. Kant Sharma*, *K. Vijay Rao v. State of Karnataka* (on proportionality) and *B. S. Jain v. Union of India* (on “act prejudicial to good order”).  
* **Decision** – The Supreme Court may: <br>1. **Allow** the appeal and set aside the AFT order. <br>2. **Partially allow** (e.g., modify the punishment). <br>3. **Dismiss** the appeal (if the Court finds no error of law).

## 4.  Key Points to Emphasise in the Appeal  

1. **Statutory Hierarchy** – Section 63 of the Army Act is a *penal provision* that must be read in harmony with the *Arms Act* and the *principle of “nullum crimen sine lege”*. The Tribunal’s finding of guilt under Sec. 63, despite an acquittal under the Arms Act, is a *juridical inconsistency*.  

2. **Substantial Question of Law** – The core issue is whether *possession of cash* (Rs 28,000) without satisfactory explanation can, by itself, constitute an “act prejudicial to good order and military discipline” under Sec. 63 when the underlying *illegal possession* element (as defined in the Arms Act) is absent. This question has *general public importance* because it affects all service‑persons facing similar charges.  

3. **Proportionality & Punishment** – Compulsory retirement for a *cash‑possession* offence, without any proven breach of the Arms Act, is *grossly disproportionate* (see *State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh*, 1999). The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that military punishments must be *reasonable* and *commensurate* with the misconduct.  

4. **Procedural Fairness** – The Tribunal dismissed the review *without* giving the appellant an opportunity to argue on the *legal* merits of the conviction (contrary to the principles of natural justice). This procedural lapse can be a ground for setting aside the order.  

5. **Effect of Superannuation** – Although the appellant has attained the age of superannuation, the *right to a clean service record* and *pension benefits* continues. The Supreme Court has entertained appeals even after retirement where the *remedial relief* (e.g., restoration of rank, pension enhancement) is at stake (*Union of India v. Major General R. K. Rathore*, 2017).

## 5.  Suggested Immediate Actions  

1. **Engage counsel** experienced in military law and Supreme Court practice **within the next 3 days** to draft the MoA.  
2. **Collect and organise** all documentary evidence: Tribunal judgment, leave‑to‑appeal order, condonation order, service records, pension statements, and any relevant Army Act provisions.  
3. **File the MoA** **as soon as possible** (the Supreme Court does not impose a strict time‑limit for filing after leave is granted, but promptness strengthens the case and avoids any argument of laches).  
4. **Simultaneously file a stay application** under Article 226 (Delhi High Court) *or* under Section 31(3) of the AFT Act, requesting that the compulsory retirement be suspended until the Supreme Court decides the appeal.  
5. **Prepare a concise “Points‑of‑Law” booklet** (max 5 pages) for the judges, highlighting the three pillars above (statutory inconsistency, proportionality, procedural fairness).

### Bottom Line  

- **Section 31 of the Armed Forces Tribunal Act** gives a *direct right* of appeal to the Supreme Court.  
- The **procedure** is: (i) obtain leave to appeal from the Tribunal; (ii) (if needed) obtain condonation of delay; (iii) file a **Memorandum of Appeal** before the Supreme Court complying with **Rule 5/6 CPC & Supreme Court Rules**; (iv) pay the court‑fee; (v) serve the respondent; (vi) optionally seek a stay; (vii) argue the *substantial question of law* at the Supreme Court hearing.  

Following the checklist and emphasizing the legal errors identified above will give the appellant the best chance of overturning the Tribunal’s conviction and the punitive retirement order.
